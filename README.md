# PONGGAME
A 2D Pong game written in Java
To start the game you will need to click the button on the menu page and automatically the game will being. 
The game is surrounded around the idea of Pong, however instead of two rectangles (paddles) it only consists of one long rectangle 
moving left to right with the help of the left and right keyboard keys(as interaction). 
There are two balls that will have to bounce of the rectangle in order for you to stay in the game. 
Each ball bouncing of the rectangle will give you a one point for your score. If one ball hits the bottom of the frame it is game over. 
To make the game a little more complex the gamer will be in for a shock as when they reach a total of 10 points one of the ball leaves 
the game and the remaining gets faster making it harder for you to catch the ball with the rectangle in order for you to stay in the game.
